After I discovered the secret to turning my Monday blues to Friday euphoria (spoiler alert - coding!), I quit my management role at Raytheon Technologies to pursue my passion. In addition to coding, I have over 10 years of Key Account Sales Management experience in the commercial aerospace sector along with a Bachelor of Engineering in Aerospace Systems.

## How did I get into coding?

I have always possessed the mindset of a programmer - the ability to find solutions to real world problems. Even during my bachelorâ€™s in aerospace systems engineering, I was consistently drawn to avionics architecture, ARINC databuses and their communication protocols. I also covered Aerothermodynamics and propulsion, but it was always the systems portions that really excited me. I have come to recognize that I possess a personality that is driven by my ability to overcome complex challenges. With coding, I have found it to be the summation of complex problem solving that has the power to make a genuine difference in the world. It is truly an endeavor like no other.

## Softskills

* Problem solving mentality
* Self-starter with meticulous time-management skills
* Extensive communication experience across organizations (up to C-level)
* Customer-oriented mentality with a focus on putting the client's needs first
* Experienced in giving presentations in front of large audiences (+300)
